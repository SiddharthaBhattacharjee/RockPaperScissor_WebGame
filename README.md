# RockPaperScissor_WebGame
I made a fun web game of Rock Paper Scissor, Bringing back the classic childhood game in a single player experience where you will play the game with E.T. a very moody bot whose expression changes depending upon the score. The game is made using HTML,CSS and JS and is made for practicing and learning purpose.
